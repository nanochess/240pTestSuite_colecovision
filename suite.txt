Choose items from the menu by moving the stick up and down using any controller.

Select item by pressing any side-buttons on any controller.

Notes for MSX:

Left-side button is space or button 1. Right-side button is M or button 2.

Keypad # is mapped to keyboard Z. Keypad * is mapped to keyboard X.

*** Test Patterns > Color Bleed Check.

This patterns helps diagnose unneeded color up-sampling. It consists of one pixel width color bars alternating with one pixel width black bars.

You can change the vertical bars to a checkerboard by pressing the left side button.

*** Test Patterns > Monoscope

Displays a pattern arrangement for monitor alignment.

The aspect ratio has been measured with calibrated NTSC monitors to make sure the red lines make a square.

*** Test Patterns > Grid

Displays a grid borrowed from the CPS-2 grid. It is used to determine how many pixels are hidden in the border of the screen.

*** Test Patterns > White & Black Screens.

As the name implies, the screen is filled with solid white.

Pressing the left side button will toggle between white, black, and the "ultrablack" border color.

A full white screen usually makes evident audio interference in some RGB cables.

The fully black screen might cause some displays or upscan converters to stop recognizing the signal, which is a common (and undesirable) condition during gameplay.

TODO: Measure the "ultrablack" color.

*** Test Patterns > Sharpness.

You should set the sharpness of your display to a value that shows clean black and gray transitions, with no white ghosting in between.

On most modern displays, the sharpness control is an edge-enhancement control, and most probably should be set to zero, or in the middle.

In some PVM/BVM displays this is also referred to as aperture.

*** Test Patterns > VDP Color Bars.

Display all the VDP colors in a column arrangement.

TODO: Measure voltage levels.

*** Video tests > Drop Shadow Test.

Move shadow using the stick of any controller.

Press left button to alternate frame where shadow is drawn.

Press right button to toggle sprite.

Press key * to exit test.

*** Video tests > Striped Sprite Test.

Move shadow using the stick of any controller.

Press any side button or key * to exit test.

*** Video tests > Checkerboard.

Press left button to alternate pixels on each frame.

Press right button to switch pixels on each press.

Press key # to show frame count.

Press key * to exit test.

*** Video tests > Lag Test.

This test is used to do a comparison against a monitor with known lag. A picture is taken in order to do a comparison of both monitors.

Press any side button or the key * to exit test.

*** Video tests > Timing & Reflex Test.

An empirical lag test based on visual and audio cues.

Press the left side button when the moving sprite is aligned with the fixed sprite. After 10 times the results are shown.

Press the right side button to change the moving sprite to vertical/horizontal movement or to show both.

Press key # to remove random variation.

Press key * to exit test.

*** Video tests > Grid scroll.

Move stick up and down to accelerate or reduce speed.

Move stick left and right to switch square to diagonal pattern.

Press left button to pause movement.

Press right button to switch scroll direction in X or Y.

Press key # to reverse direction.

Press key * to exit test.

*** Video tests > Horizontal stripes.

Press left button to enable alternate stripe lines on each frame.

Press right button to switch stripe lines on each press.
